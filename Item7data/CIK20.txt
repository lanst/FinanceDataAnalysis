amended and extended loan arrangements with respect to its debt and there are
no defaults under any of the existing loan agreements all current loan
agreements are with the company's us and swiss manufacturing subsidiaries

      in june  the company's us manufacturing subsidiary entered into a
two-year secured revolving credit facility with a lender which provides for a
maximum borrowing of  subject to certain limitations based upon
inventory and receivable levels the interest rate at january   was 
at january   there were no borrowings under the agreement also in june
 the company's us manufacturing subsidiary obtained a 
twenty-year mortgage loan at an interest rate of  monthly principal and
interest payments are  every five years the bank has the right to review
the mortgage and adjust its terms including due dates and interest rates with
the first such right occurring in june  at january   the amount
borrowed under the mortgage loan was 

      as a result of the swiss forbearance agreement referred to in the
"overview" the board of directors of the company's swiss manufacturing
subsidiary was expanded from one director to three directors with one of the
directors being designated by the swiss lenders in addition the swiss lenders
imposed a number of limitations and requirements on the swiss subsidiary
including certain restrictions on intercompany transactions with k-tron's us
companies and a prohibition on the payment of management fees to the company
after march   as part of the february  agreement amending and
extending the forbearance agreement with the swiss lenders to march  
the swiss subsidiary agreed to a  average reduction in the maximum amount
that may be borrowed under its operating lines of credit effective april 
 and also agreed not to terminate the existing arrangement prior to march
  and the swiss lenders agreed to continue to defer until march  
the repayment of credit lines and the principal payments on fixed loans that
become due prior to that date effective april   interest rates on the
swiss lines of credit were adjusted to

adjusted on the next renewal dates

      at january   the swiss subsidiary achieved better than a  to 
debt to equity ratio and accordingly on march   the  interest premium
will terminate the swiss lenders will cease to have the right to designate one
director of the swiss subsidiary and certain other restrictions will end
moreover the swiss lenders have requested that the swiss forbearance agreement
also terminate at that time rather than on march   and the company's
swiss subsidiary has agreed in principle to this request provided that
satisfactory new loan arrangements with the swiss lenders are in place by that
date

      at january   the company's swiss subsidiary had  borrowed
under short-term lines of credit with swiss lenders the interest rates
including the  premium described above on the lines of credit ranged from
